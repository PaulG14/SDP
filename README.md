# Spread Spectrum-Based Optical Layer Security
An implementation of CCP and FCAP policies in an elastic optical network

To introduce physical (optical) layer security and protect Elastic Optical Networks against
eavesdropping attacks, spread spectrum with signal overlapping techniques can be used to encode
confidential connections. The aim of this Thesis project is to implement different routing strategies,
as well as different spectrum/code allocation policies, to utilize several levels of security for the
confidential connections. This problem can be solved by implementing heuristic Integer Linear Program (ILP)
formulation approaches.
